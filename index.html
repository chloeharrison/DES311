							<h6>WHAT IS CREATIVE ENTREPRENEURSHIP?</h6>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
						<h3>Learning Summary</h3>
						<p>During the first lecture of this module we were given an overview of what was to be expected in the module and what we would be covering over the 
						   course of the year. For this module we will be making Icons and a promotional website were the icons we create. Through looking at past projects this
                           got me thinking on how I'm going to design my icons and website and what theme they are going to be. Also in this weeks lecture we started to learn
                           what creative entrepreneurship is and how entrepreneurs turn their ideas	into a service or a product. The quote below which was in the lecture got me
                           thinking and inspired me to come up with ideas for my icons.<br>  
                           <i>“The critical ingredient is getting oﬀ your butt and doing something. It’s as simple as that. A lot of people have ideas, but there
     					are few who decide to do something about them now. Not tomorrow. Not next week. But today. The true entrepreneur is a doer, not a 
						dreamer.”</i><b>—Nolan Bushnell, entrepreneur</b>                      	   
						   </p>
                       <h3>How to design a top-quality icon set</h3> 
                       <p> I read the <a href="http://www.creativebloq.com/graphic-design/how-design-top-quality-icon-10135092" >Creative Blog</a>article suggested to us in the lecture, in order to gather some tips on how to start developing and designing my own icon set.I found this article useful because in it he goes through the different stages of his process, for example the discover phase; where keywords are identified and the “perfect representation” for the words are thought of using images or symbols. He also emphasises the importance of starting on paper and continuously sketching your ideas for the icons out, for initial ideas and changes because this will save time when it comes to using Photoshop/Illustrator.</p>

                          <p> Eugeniu Clim, an Interaction Designer at Us two believes that there are some steps designers should follow in order to create the best quality icon sets:</p>

                            
      <ol>
  <li>Who would you spend it with? </li>
  <li>What would you do? </li>
  <li>Where would you go?</li>
  <li>Would you spend a work day differently than a non work day?</li>               
  
  </ol>			                          
			                      
    <ol>                        
                            
                            
                            
                            <li>Discovery Stage</li>

        <p>This is the important stage where I must analyse the brief/ assignment I've been given. I will then research Images and symbols that have a direct association with concepts I need to communication in my icon set. I should begin with some rough sketching of my ideas.</p>

<li>Design Stage</li>

        <p>Using mood boards at this stage will help me convey the sought after look and feel I want my icon set to have as the end result. A lot of detail will be great for the finished product as it shows the effort put into each icon, however it could also be a distraction, so I need to find a good balance.</p>

<li>Implementation Stage</li>

        <p>This is the final stage where all the icons created must be tested within the actual interface, to see how well everything works together. It's at this stage that icons can be changed and adjusted to what looks best.</p>
        
                            </ol>

						<h3>7 Principles of Effective Icon Design</h3>
						<br>
<p>From reading this article from the website <a href="https://design.tutsplus.com/articles/7-principles-of-effective-icon-design--psd-147" >Tuts Plus</a> really helped me consider these 7 points below. What really helped me was a section ofthis article talks about designing for the size the icon will be used at. This really stuck out at me because it was a question that I had myself, should an icon be designed larger with loads of detail then scaled down? “If you go vector and make your icon in Illustrator, there is an inherent temptation to scale the design, and try to use it at any size. This doesn’t work with icons. What looks good at 512px looks like a blurry smear at 16px.” 
</p>
<br>
<ol>
<li>Approach Icon Design Holistically</li>
<li>Consider Your Audience </li>
<li>Design for the Size the Icon will be Used At </li>
<li>Keep Icons Simple and Iconic</li>
<li>Cast Consistent Lighting, Reflections, and Shadows </li>
<li>Utilize a Limited Perspective</li>
<li>Create Consistent Icon Set Styles</li>
</ol>

						<h4>Kyle Adams</h4>
						<p>Kyle Adams is a  a UI/UX Designer/Developer from San Antonio, Texas. His passion is icons is very clear has on his website he is
						   very keen to show and inspire others how to create icons and you can definitely tell from his work. 
						   They look so smooth and perfect.The colours and shading he uses in his icons add depth and character tohis icons. I think it’s really 
						   great that he’s able to give a sandwich or a cookie tonnes of personality by adding two dots for eyes 
						   and a mouth. This style and colour is something I am looking for when creating my icons.</p>

						<p>Jordan Jenkins is a freelance Visual Designer, specialising in Branding and Illustration. This a designer that I found
						   on Dribble and liked the retro feel his designs have. I also like how the second image which is called Pokemon x Zelda and 
						   fourth image is called POP icons move and this makes them come alive. I never considered making icons into gif's and making 
						   them move and feel that this will add more interest to my icons. I know this can be done on Adobe After Effects but I will need to
						   brush up on these skills .

						<h4>Vic Bell</h4>
						<p>	Vic Bell is an illustrator and designer from the North of England. I found her work to be unique and quirky 
                            which is the style I like. I also like how some of her icons have colour and some are just line drawings but 
							still has colour in them which I didn't think was possible. I wasn't sure of just line drawings for icons at first
							but after looking at Vic Bell's work it has really made me think of doing some of my icons in a similar style.

							<h4>Kyle Tezak</h4>
						<p>	Kyle is an independent designer and illustrator in Minneapolis, Minnesota. He works with all kinds of companies on projects ranging from brand identity 
						    and product design to editorial illustration and large icon sets. I like how simple the drawings look and you can clearly tell what every icon is and also
							how he uses a feww colours for each icon set for example "The Reservior Dogs" icon set he uses just yellow, white, red and a black outline.

							<h6>THE CREATIVE PROCESS</h6>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
						<h3>Learning Summary</h3>
						<p> In this weeks lecture I learnt about the 5 steps by James Young to help generate and solidify ideas, as well as the rituals of preparation which can help creativity. These 5 steps are:
                            <ol>
  <li>Gather raw material – Not just for the project in hand but gather material for everything that interests you. </li>
  <li>Digest what you have gathered – Once you have exhausted your research, allow time for the material to assimilate.</li>
  <li>Unconscious processing – Sleep on it and allow your subconscious do the hard work for you.</li>
  <li>Everything clicks into place – As Young calls it “a-ha! moment” when your idea seemingly comes out of thin air.</li>               
  <li>Idea meets reality – As Young puts it your idea meets “the cold, grey dawn of the morning after,” and has to face reality. This is when you can seek feedback from your peers to check how robust your idea is.</li>
  </ol>
                                
 <p>Looking at the 5 steps by James Young I realise that I go through these 5 stages when I'm working on a project and really made me think on how the process that I'm going through when I am creating my own icon set and website.</p>    

                             <h3> Mind Map</h3>

 <h3> Master Apprentice</h3>                                                         
<p>The master and apprentice approach to work is something I never heard of before but is something that I have been doing along as I have completed 
tutorials for different projects and copied their design. This teaches you how to design in a particular style and also helps you improve on your own design
 skills.This week I tried to the Master Apprentice approach and here are some of my creations:</p>
<p> This is a  basic camera that was a icon tutorial that was available on Adobe illustrator. I felt I wanted to a tutorial as I wanted to get familar with Adobe Illustrator again. Here is the camera below:

   <p>Here is Vic Bell polar bear that I researched earlier the original is on the left and my is on the right. One of my icon ideas was animals and I wanted to 
   try and draw an animals. For my icons I thought about drawing my icons as line drawings so I wanted to see if I could recreate this similar style. I enjoyed
   drawing this polar bear but found it harder than I thought it would be as I had to make sure the all the lines were smooth and linked together. Although I liked
   the idea of line drawing icons I feel that this really isn't my style and want to experiment with icons that have colour.

							<h2>Week 3</h2>
							<h6>STANDING OUT FROM THE CROWD</h6>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
						<h3>Learning Summary</h3>
<p>For this week's lecture we were meant to have a guest lecturer, Dr. Rachael Gawley. However she was unable to come, therefore the lecture series continues
 until a replacement is organised.The main aim of this week's lecture was to really think about what makes you stand out from the crowd. What makes my work
 different from any other young designer. As there's literally hundreds, globally, thousands, of young and up-and-coming designers and developers surfacing 
 into the jobs market every year. Also learning the importance of being nice to everyone you meet in life as you never know who you meet and this will help build
 strong relationships not only in the design world but also in life.</p>
 
 <p>We also we advised that being active online on at least one social media platform is very important as you never know who is going to see your work and 
 when its going to take off and being on a social media platform could trigger your major success. I realised from this that there is wider network, which 
 is the world, not just the people in my class or other universities in Northern Ireland, but there is people all around the world in the same position as me 
 and I need to find my place and show how I am different. Not only this but we looked at how side projects can benefit us and after today’s lecture, This got me thinking about looking into different side projects
 and possibly stand one. When I first heard the quote I didn't fully understand what the quote meant but realised that if you do something because you love it
 then you find what you are looking for.</p> 
<i>"You can be stronger when you are not wanting it, if you just do it out of love and trust, then that is when you find what you are looking for."</i> <b>- Samuel T Herring</b>
 <br>
 <br>
	<h3>Inspiration vs Imitation - Jessica Hische</h3>	
	<i><b>“Always keep practicing (and practicing, and practicing), keep looking at beautiful work, keep researching others to look up to and be inspired by. In no time you’ll be making beautiful original work of your own.”</b></i>
	<br>
	 <br>
	<p>The last two sentences of this article stood out to me the most out of the entire article. It basically sums up every point she made about the difference between using someone else’s work for inspiration, and imitating it - a line that can be blurred especially by new designers. It’s easy to fall on to the path of just creating things that are the same as everyone else, and in some cases exactly the same - but it’s taking the time to practice away from the watchful eyes of everyone to build your skills and become just as good as your inspiration - and keeping this practice to yourself is just as important. 
This article really opened my eyes and taught me not to publish absolutely everything I create, even though there is an element of pressure as a website design student to constantly be creating and releasing side projects and university work. Jessica Hische reminds us that to let “practice fuel original work and then publish to your heart’s content”.
She also mentions that we should diversify our inspirations, because often times our work tends to look like a combination of those who inspire us because we like their style. It’s ok to find a style that we like and stick to it, but that we should train our eyes to allow us to create original work and add our own quirks to our style.</p>

								<h3> Sketches</h3>  
<p> Before putting my ideas to computer I decided to put pen to paper so I can visually see what my idea will look like. Also looking at my mind map of ideas I narrowed my ideas down to four themes, these are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Animals</li>
<li>Cocktails</li>
<li>Gaming</li>
<li>Weather</li>
</ol>

<p>Although I really loved the idea of creating the icons based around animals as I love animals, I started to realise that I didn’t have an idea on how to display them for the website and started to lose interest in the idea.Now that I’ve settled on an idea, I’m starting to plan my icons which is Flags.</p>
            <br>
<br>                
 <h3>Flag Icons</h3>

<p>From watching the TV show The Big Bang Theory were one of the main Tv characters which has a YouTube/podcast called “Fun with flags” which got me thinking about doing icons on different flags of the world. Here is a clip of the show:</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PD_i2F4ZJJk?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>Now, my main idea is to create 12 or more icons based around flags. As I’ve had this idea in my head and I have a few ideas about different icons and how I was going to create the promotional website for the icons I could create I felt like this was the idea to go for. To get inspiration for my own flag icons I researched flag icons on Google to see what was already out there and here is what I found below. </p>

						<h3> Experiments</h3>  
							<p> Before I decided on the final look of my icons I decided to do some experiments on how my icons will look. I decided to take one of the flags I am going to do and see which style I feel is the best which is the Spain flag</p>
							<br>
<p>For this I like the stroke thickness and like the icon designer I researched Vic Bell who did line drawing I thought I try this for my flag icons but realised that this wouldn't work for my icons as you need colour to know what each flag is and wouldn't work with the style of website I have in mind to create.</p>

									</div>
								</div>
									</div>	
<br>
<p>I thought for this I would play around with the different stroke styles but feel that this is too much and won't appeal to people and realised that I wanted all my likes to be the same and straight.</p>

									</div>
								</div>
									</div>
<br>		
<p>I feel now that adding colour is very important and will work will with my website that I am going to create. But wanted to try to make the line thickness thinner to see how it looked but preferred the line thickness to be thicker.  </p>

								</div>
									</div>	
									<br>
<p>This is the style I'm looking for but thought I would add some typography by naming the what the country is for each flag but realised that some people may want to use them as learning aids and therefore wouldn't want the names of the country on every flag.</p>

						<h3>Learning Summary</h3>
                        <p>In this lecture we were learning about how to build a good foundation for your business, what goals you want to achieve in business and in life and also the importance of having a brand.
                        First of all we looked at these points that help when building your business foundation:</p>
                        <ol>
  <li>Focus on the long term </li>
  <li>Set Financial Goals </li>
  <li>Assess Market conditions</li>
  <li>Consider your skillset</li>               
  <li>Be aware of what is happening in your industry</li>
  <li>Implementation</li>
 <li>Have a money backup plan</li>
  </ol>
                        
 <p> We also discussed how to create a business model that works for you and asking what you want to achieve? and what is success to you? as success can mean so many different things to different people. Also looking at how you are going to spend your day is going to look like? </p>		
<ol>
  <li>Who would you spend it with? </li>
  <li>What would you do? </li>
  <li>Where would you go?</li>
  <li>Would you spend a work day differently than a non work day?</li>               
  
  </ol>			                          
							
                            <p>We covered how to select the right company structure for you. When you choose a sole trader, they have 100% responsibility for your business and they will also receive 100% of the profits made within the business. If you decide to have a partnership within your business, then it's the same 100% responsibility as the sole trader, however it will involve more than two people. You can also set up a Limited Liability Company (LLC), this is the best option if you plan to sell your company in the future, as members of the company can't be held responsible for the company's debts or liabilities.</p>

                            <p>Choosing the right name for your business

                                This is the most important part of setting up any business. The most important things to remember including:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Building a personal brand: Use your own unique name</li>

<li>Always look to the future:</li>

<li>Dream Big</li>

<li> Don't rush it</li>

<li>Research is essential: If the name is already in use, think of another</li>

<li>Use a phrase or a statement	</li>
    
                            </ol>

							<h6>MINIMUM VIABLE PRODUCT</h6>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
						<h3>Learning Summary</h3>
							<p>A Minimum viable product is a small entry basic product to see if it gathers the interest of the public. It essentially tests the market upon which we can scale based on its interest. The best example of this is a plain doughnut. If the market likes the doughnut then we can add a variety of toppings and flavours, in order to further expand the product to reach a wider audience.</p>

<p>In relation to my assignment deliverable, the minimum viable product will be the icons that I design and produce. Then I will create and build the promotional website which will display my icon set.</p>

<p>The perfect example of a MVP is Zappos. Zapoos is a website which offers the best selection of shoes in terms of brands, style and colour. It was set up in 1999 by Nick Swinmurn, after he realised that there was no major online retailer that specialized in shoes. Although Zappos wasn't a scalable business, it went on to earn $1.2 billion and became the largest online shoe store. This example demonstrates that this was a MVP experience for Swinmurn as he had an idea of a product in which he wanted to see if it would work, and it was successful.</p>

<p>Groupon is another massive MVP as it first started as a blog in Chicago offering half price pizzas in November 2008. It then became one of the fastest-growing companies in history. It's roughly valued at $13 billion now.
</p>

							<p>This weeks lecture was a group critique of everyone work. This was very interesting as I got to see what other people's icons were and how they were designed.I found this very beneficial as this got me thinking of improvements that I can make to my own icons for example making sure they were the same size and also fix my Union jack flag as it didn't look as slick as the other flag icons. </p>

							<h6>GUEST LECTURER: DR.PHIL STRAIN, SPOTIFY</h6>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
							<h3>Learning Summary</h3>
						<p>To start the lecture, we were reminded with an update on were we should be with our icons sets, and that we should be moving onto which was the next set of set icons. He also said that we should be now be thinking about the promotional website for the icons and how this will look, he suggested maybe a paper design, something to get a visual of what the website would and could look like. The website also would have to be something that had narrative to it and something that had depth and meaning than just a set of icons.</p>
							
						<p>This week’s we had a guest lecturer called Dr Phil Strain from 
							<a href="https://www.spotify.com/uk/">Spotify</a>  who is a User Experience researcher.    He has worked at some major businesses such as Apple, Google, Spotify. He started off by saying his real passion was for music and wanted to enter the music industry but got inspired to go into accessibility in technology from a neighbour who was blind and was very dependent on technology such as screen readers. 

</p>	
			

<p>Throughout the whole lecture he explained he explained his career journey and while at university he started considering internships at big companies as he felt this was a good way to get to know the real working world and how some of the big businesses would operate. While at Google he started as a usability analyst in 2005 and then moving into user experience researcher as this was something that interested him greatly. He worked on things like adding semantic headers to google results page for searches, this allowed users to jump through the content more effectively. He also provided positive feedback for headers, accessibility in google search, which is something that still exists on google webpage today.</p> 

<p>Another project that he worked on while at Google was a Google accessibility feature this was a screen reader given the name of Chrome Box, from this he was then provided with the opportunity to work in London for Google as Google AdSense Lead Researcher. During this time, he basically was helping web publishers can create money for their own businesses by placing ads in their webpage, self-advertising. Phil was mainly involved front end of AdSense.</p>

<p>Although Dr Phil Strain enjoyed his time at Google, but it wasn't exactly his passion the projects he was working on. So, it was when he had open heart surgery which put things into perspective for him that made him decide to work on things that he was passionate about. He then moved onto Apple and talked about his experience at Apple, one of the biggest, if not the biggest technological company in the world and how they were allowing developers to create apps, and one of the examples he give was of a fellow IMD student Lee Monroe an app developer who built a team developed that were responsible for creating Used Cars NI and City Beat apps respectively. He then explained the different working environments between Apple and Google with Google being a warm and friendly environment and Apple to have a serious demeanour. 
During this time, he also was a LinkedIn recruiter which was to give others the opportunity to work for Apple in London. In total Phil spent about 18 months at apple, in which he described as an incredible learning experience. But he then was keen to move around more and was offered a position at LinkedIn and Spotify. Some of his next projects were a Sprint by Jake Knapp which was a problem solving and testing know how.</p> 

<p>He then moved onto a team called GLUE this team was responsible for making Spotify become more rounded and have all of their designs on each platform look and feel as one which was not the case before hand. Each platform seemed to be like a different brand but under the same name, there was no consistency with Spotify as a whole, and someone that didn’t know what it was would not have known that these products were all from the same brand, also they didn’t have the same values that Spotify wanted its user to feel which was,
<ol> 
<li>Passionate </li>
<li>Sincere</li> 
<li>Playful </li>
<li>Innovative </li>
<li>Collaborative </li>
</ol>
The lecture finished up with an overview of his career to date, he stressed that there was nothing wrong with experiencing different companies and how they work he said that if you personally feel that the company your working at is a good fit, stay and build a career at that company. Before starting to work he thought that it was a poor refection on him if he was to move from job to job but in fact found it his strength as each company that he went to he was able to bring something new and fresh each time while also say that he has worked for some of these big companies.  Overall his talk provided valid points which is to work with what you love and take all opportunities that are available to you.</p>

<h3>How the Icons were created </h3>
<p>In Adobe Illustrator I started by making the outline for all my flags which is a rectangle shape. Using the rectangle tool I drew a rectangle with a width of 877px and height of 595px. I also changed the strokes of the rectangle to the colour black and the thickness of 4px. </p>

<p>Depending on what flag I changed the background colour of the rectangle I created earlier, in this example I changed it to red.</p>

								</div>
  							</div>	
<br>
<p>Depending on the flag I used different shape tools such as the rectangle tool,Ellispe tool,polygon tool and the star tool to create the different shapes in each flag. But for some flags such as the UK and Brazil flag I used the clipping mask to join the different shapes together. But for this example I just used the rectangle tool and placed in the middle of the bigger rectangle. For all the shapes create I kept the stroke thickness to 4px.</p>

							<h2>Week 8 </h2>
							<h6>GUEST LECTURER: ADAM MCPEAKE, I LOVE BASS AND HYPEFACTORY</h6>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
						<h3>Learning Summary</h3>
							<p>This week’s lecture started with a summary of where we should be with our icons, at this stage we should have begun our next 6 icons and looking to have them finished up by next week’s class. Also, to continue to think about the narrative around the icons and how they are going to be presented on your website
	</p>
							
	<p>
							Our Guest speaker who was Adam McPeake from  <a href="http://www.ilovebass.co.uk/">I love Bass</a> and the <a href="http://thehypefactory.uk/">Hypefactory</a>. Adam was himself a IMD graduate who went on to start his own companies. Adam's first company called I Love Bass is an online magazine for cars which website dedicated to bringing exclusive features, event reports and information from the Ireland, UK and International modified car scene. Adam's second company called the Hypefactory is a video/media company that provide a range of photography, videography and other media services for one off projects or regular events such as Boojum and Citroen.
			</p>
												   						   		   
						
							
			<p>
			This started from when Adam was young when he made skateboarding films and later on gaming on his Xbox where you can record what you are playing and also share them online which involved creating your own website to show his videos. He also started by doing small car videos that he himself described as very bad, but he recognised this as a starting point him and he improved from this by learning from each job he completed.  He started with freelancing which give him a variety of jobs that he could broaden his skill set which he said was very beneficial to him when he looks back, as he was able to learn an awful lot during this experience. 
			
			
			
			
</p>			
							
				
<p>	
	After he had graduated from university and with a full-time job offer he decided not to peruse his full-time job offer and wanted to further build on his small business that he had created which was I Love Bass . Adam also discussed that when asked to do a job he rarely said no to a job even though at the time didn’t have the skills to complete the job as he learnt the skills needed on the job.


When he had started to get more clients, he was able to employ some staff to work for him as he was beginning to grow rapidly and could not complete all the work herself. With this extra work, he was then able to take on more jobs that required more specific elements, for example like animation which was something that he was not very good at himself but because he had employed staff that were better in this area than he was meaning then that that he was able to offer more variety to his customers. 

		
</p>							
	<p>
	This was the start of his multimedia production company called ‘I Love Bass’ although he had started this business whilst in university, but this was not something that he had taken overly serious and was something that he was doing on the side during his studies, he now was making money rather than just breaking even as he had described. He continued doing promotional videos but his video where being noticed by all the right people and soon big companies like Heineken, Roundstone, W5, Redbull, SSE, Citroen and more wanted some work done and this is then around the time he launched another business called the The Hype Factory.



Throughout Adam shared many videos with the group and showed how his material had improved from his humble beginnings to now making proper video promotional videos for world renowned businesses and getting to travel all over the world while doing what he loves. 

	
	
	
	
	
	
</p>	
							
	<p>
To finish Adam once again reminded us of how he started his business with no real business plan and took many risks and explained that he always asks plenty of questions to everyone he would meet and his curiosity in different video styles and interpretations of how to promote business is what has made his business desirable and successful today. He went on to say that from he was our age he got his work out there through his own personal website where he shared his video’s and paid hosting with his dad’s credit card basic but through this got people talking about what he done through online forums and more. He also advertised his I Love Bass merchandise through this website and it also boosted his reputation and he also made some extra money from this too. 

YouTube was a very important platform that helped showcase his work to a whole new audience and he was attracting interest from viewers all over the world. Club videos for nightclubs around Belfast he described as time consuming but necessary to show off his skills. Overall Adam talk opened my made me realise that taking risks is a good thing and can really pay off.

<h3>Website Research</h3>	
<p>To help create my promotional website I decided to look at different website designs so that I can get a better idea of what way I want to design my website.</p>						
				
<a href="http://jessandruss.us/">JessandRuss</a>	
<p>In this website I liked the way the text was animated which made it look simple and elegant. </p>

<h3>Making a game for my promotional website?</h3>								
<p>To be honest I hadn't thought about making a game for my promotional website but it was having a chat with Paul in the Lab session that got me interested into making a simple game using my icons. Here are a few games that I researched to give me a few ideas on what game to create:   </p>

							<h2>Week 9</h2>
							<h6>DIGITAL PRICING MODELS</h6>
						</header>
						<div class="content">

<h3>Learning Summary</h3>
<p>To start this week’s lecture, we were told how our submissions for DES311 will be uploaded onto Blackboard which will be three URL links for the different parts of the submission which are:</p>
<ol>
<li>The promotional website</li>
<li>The Icons</li>
<li>The research and learning log</li>
</ol>
<p>This week’s lecture was about the topic of Digital Pricing models. Pricing is a very critical aspect of getting your work out to the public. If priced correctly you can reach a wide audience and if people want it, you can be successful. However, incorrectly pricing your work will have the opposite effect. Overpricing will drive audiences away and under-pricing won’t help make you money. When pricing a product, you must take the quality and demand of such a product in mind. The lecture gave a good example with Apple. Apple products are typically extremely expensive compared to similar products, but people are willing to buy because they believe in the quality of Apple products. Apple’s success will only last if they are able to keep supplying the demand for high quality products. Another example of pricing given is the company Mailchimp. They offer volume sales with different price tiers. Their success depends on their customer companies sending high volumes of emails a month and paying for their service. Increased volume equals increased cost. Tiered pricing is used to give customers options such as starting low and then if they like the product they may be willing to go up a tier. The final main point of the lecture is that there is no real answer to the correct pricing.  Also in the lecture we were shown a good website called <a href="http://ournameismud.co.uk/fraq/">UK freelance rates calculator </a>which figures out how much you should charge for your freelance this depends on your experience and what you specialise in.</p>

<p>In the lecture we learnt the importance of negotiation as clients may have a different budget in mind compared to what it really costs. Also, we looked at different pricing strategies which were charge by the hour or by project. If you were to track by the hour it is important to track your time on the project by writing how long every detail of the project took to complete. Personally, I think pricing by the project is best because some projects take longer to complete compared to others and every project requires different resource, for example designing a simple leaflet doesn’t require as much time and resources compared to a website which requires a shopping cart.

When pricing it is important to consider these different factors when doing a freelance job, these are:
<ol>
<li>Paper</li>
<li>Pens </li>
<li>Photocopies </li>
<li>Colour Copies </li>
<li>Expenses such as Parking, Mobile Phone, Internet and Car </li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>Therefore, you should keep all the receipts for a job so that you know exactly how much you have spent on that job. We also covered the importance of professionalism as the world is a small place you don’t know if you will be working with that person again, so it is important to deliver your work to a high standard and help others as they may be more than likely to return the favour. Also, to make sure you write everything down as things may be said at a meeting that you don’t remember and to make sure that you and the client know what is happening and what is agreed to. Therefore, you should write out a contract between you and the client to set out terms and conditions, in this contract could be how much of a deposit is required, what work is there to be carried out and when the money should be paid by e.g. within 30 days. A great website that helps draw up a contract is called <a href="https://stuffandnonsense.co.uk/projects/contract-killer/"> Contract killer</a>.</p>

<p>Another way some websites such as <a href="https://www.hubspot.com/pricing/marketing">HubSpot </a> and <a href="https://github.com/pricing">Github</a> price is tier pricing. This is offering you three different options, one of the options could be a luxury packages which offers you all the top service, the second tier may offer you some of the top services but a lower price while there may be a basic package which offers you what you need. This is a good way as someone will always pick one of the tiers.

Other pricing options are that you can pay what you want, which is like making a donation. Also pay with a tweet is another way, even though you are not receiving an actual money payment this can be used as another way to get you name out there as the person as to tweet to get the icons. Other payment buttons available which you can purchase icons from are<a href="https://stripe.com/gb"> Stripe </a>and <a href="https://www.paypal.com/gb/home">PayPal</a>. There are also shopping carts which can be used to purchase online such as <a href="https://www.shopify.co.uk/">Shopify</a> and<a href="https://gumroad.com/"> gumroad</a>.</p>
		
<h3>Branding of icons</h3>
<p>Now that the icons are in the process of being finalised I have started to consider the branding for the icons and how the brand will be used on the website. I’m leaning towards a flat design feel to the branding because I think it will work well with the style of the icons and the ideas I have been developing of a game. Here are a few rough ideas for brand names and logo ideas:</p>

							<h2>Week 10</h2>
							<h6>WHO OWNS WHAT</h6>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
						<h3>Learning Summary</h3>
<p>To start of the lecture, we were reminded of the submission date for project which is the 8th of January 2018, and what we should be focused on over the next couple of weeks. To inspire us we went over other past students work and how they presented their icons on their promotional websites. This was very helpful as it gave us an idea of what would look best and what we would need to produce to get the best marks possible for the project. This also helped me come up with a few more ideas to improve my own website.This week's lecture was about who owns what which explained about copyrights.</p>

<p>Derivative and original works was the next topic covered in the lecture explained what they are and what the different was between them. Derivative is the Imitative of the work of another artist, writer and usually disapproved of for that reason. Copyright was a large part of this lecture and how we must always respect this law not only in our assignment but it or whole working life as there had been many people that had fell victim to this. Appropriation in art is the use of pre-existing objects or images with little or no transformation applied to them. An example of this which was explained in the lecture was of the iconic image of Barack Obama with there being may different versions of this image being created.
There are a variety of legislation that were important to be aware of some of such as:
<ol>
<li><a href="http://www.plagiarism.org/">Plagiarism </a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/intellectual-property-office">Intellectual Property</a></li> 
<li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/topic/intellectual-property/patents">Patents</a> </li>
<li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/data-protection">Data Protection Act</a></li> 
</ol>
</p>

<p>Of course, many of us like to be able to use works as inspiration and this is certainly something that most of the biggest businesses in the world have used over the years improving or modernise old works and make them more contemporary. An example of was of a video called ‘EVERYTHING IS A REMIX which was very informative and shocking something very simple got this young man into a lot of trouble as it sounded very similar to other tune which was done many years ago. While there is nothing wrong with using work as inspiration but when you make very little change to the original work and pass this work off as your own with referring to the original producer this is FRAUD! 
This happened to a former lecturer at the university who was called Tim Potter where he who created this website below but then many people started to copy this website but just changed the colour.</p>


<a href="https://creativecommons.org/">Creative Commas</a> was something that we touched on briefly and this was basically outlining how you can use work from this website Creative Commas and this would be completely free from any copyright infringement as they believe that all work deserves to be shared if the producer wants it to be improved upon and get a vast input on the designs or developments that was created. 
</p>

<h3>Website Mock up</h3>
<p>Before getting stuck into coding my website I decided to do a few mock ups to see which style I liked the best based on the sketch that I drew earlier.</p>
<h4>Website Mock up 1</h4>
<p>This idea will have a landing page with the game underneath and the footer with the same background has the landing page with the game background  remaining white so that it stands out. The buttons on the footer and landing page will remain the same shape and colour. Overall I like this idea as I feel that this will work very well with my icons.  </p>			

				 <div class="gallery">
								<div>
									<div class="image fit flush">
										<a href="images/pic50.png"><img src="images/pic50.png" width="300" height="500" alt="" /></a>
									</div>
									
								</div>
                            </div>
							<br>
							<br>
<h4>Website Mock up 2</h4>
<p>This idea will have an image background with the game. All the buttons will remain the same shape and colour to keep it consistent. Overall I'm not going to persue this idea as I feel that this won't work very well with my icons and also the background won't help make my icons stand out.  </p>	
 <div class="gallery">
								<div>
									<div class="image fit flush">
										<a href="images/pic51.png"><img src="images/pic51.png" width="300" height="500" alt="" /></a>
									</div>
									
								</div>
                            </div>
							<br>
							<br>
							<h4>Website Mock up 3</h4>
<p>This idea will have a image background for a landing page with the game underneath and the footer and the game having the same background which is white so that it stands out. The buttons on the footer and game will remain the same shape and colour. Overall I like this idea as I feel that this will work very well with my icons but I feel that something is missing to make it look better.  </p>	
 <div class="gallery">
								<div>
									<div class="image fit flush">
										<a href="images/pic52.png"><img src="images/pic52.png" width="300" height="500" alt="" /></a>
									</div>
									
								</div>
                            </div>
<br>
							<br>
<h3>Start of creating the website</h3>
<p>Looking at the different ideas I decided I wanted an animated landing page but wasn't 100% sure about how to create one so I searched on YouTube for a tutorial and came across this video by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/DrewOnCue">Drew Ryan</a> who was able to explain clearly how to create the animated landing page and what code to use to make it responsive. </p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/myZZ9YF2pqs" frameborder="0" gesture="media" allow="encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<br>
<br>
<h3>Creating Background Image</h3>
<p>In Adobe Illustrator I started drawing a rectangle using the rectangle tool for the background and change the colour to #086c95ff with no stroke just fill. For the stars I used the ellipse tool and made the all different sizes and spreading them aroun dthe rectangle name in white. As seen below.</p>
<div class="gallery">

									<div class="image fit flush">
										<a href="images/footerbg.png"><img src="images/footerbg.png" width="600" height="300" alt="" /></a>
									</div>
								</div>
  							</div>
<br>
<p>Using the ellipse tool I drew a light blue circle for the water and the stroke black with a thickness of 2px. For the clouds I used the rounded rectangle tool and drew them in different sizes and coloured them white and stroke black with a thickness of 2px.</p>
	<div class="gallery">
								<div>
									<div class="image fit flush">
										<a href="images/pic65.png"><img src="images/pic65.png" width="600" height="300" alt="" /></a>
									</div>
								</div>
  							</div>
							<br>
<p>Using a mixture of rounded rectangle, ellipse and rectangle tool and using the pathfinder to merge the shapes together to create the green parts of the earth planet. Once the shapes were drawn I used the clipping mask to clip the green shapes with the light blue circle.  </p>
<div class="gallery">
								<div>
									<div class="image fit flush">
										<a href="images/pic66.png"><img src="images/pic66.png" width="600" height="300" alt="" /></a>
									</div>
								</div>
  							</div>

<br>

<p>I creaeted the flags using the rectangle tool and the pole. Once I created one I was able duplicate them and change the colours. I also moved them behind the earth to make them look like they are stuck to the earth.</p>

							<h2>Week 11</h2>
							<h6>LIFE AS AN ENTREPRENEUR</h6>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
						<h3>Learning Summary</h3>
<p>This week’s lecture started with a reminder of the submission date for project which is the 8th of January 2018.We were also reminded on how to upload our submissions which were on Blackboard, these were split into three sections which are digital product (icons), promotional website and your research and learning log. Also reminded to have our promotional website ready as next week is the group critique. Also, we had an overview of what we covered for the past 10 weeks.

In this week’s lecture we learnt about the life of an entrepreneur, we started by looking at the different myths that being an entrepreneur are. The first one being that an entrepreneur will make lots of money but that may not be the case. Even though there are people like Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg who are worth billions this may not be the case for you and they didn’t become billionaires overnight, this took years of hard work to become that successful. Has you can set your own hours as an entrepreneur you will assume you have loads of free time, but this is not true as Lori Reiner, Shark Tank quoted
<br>
<b> <i>“Entrepreneurs are willing to work an 80-hour week to avoid working a 40-hour week”</i> </b>
</p>
<p>In this lecture we learnt that it was important not to neglect yourself and making sure that you don’t over work yourself as it can be overwhelming being an entrepreneur as you are solely responsible for your own business. Here are ways that you can make life easier for yourself:
 <ol> 
 <ul>Check your email no more than 3 times a day </ul> 
<ul>Limit social media to three times a day </ul> 
<ul>Make sure you are up to date with client work </ul> 
<ul> Make customers aware of when orders will be shipped.  </ul> 
<ul>Set an out of oﬀice message </ul>  
<ul>Tell people about it  </ul> 
<ul>Trust yourself the world won't end with unanswered emails </ul> 
 </ol> 
</p>
<p>Not only has entrepreneur but as people we aim to complete tasks to perfection, but sometime perfection can hold us back and make us not take risks and it is important to know when to let go and move on. Here are a few factors to know when perfectionism is stopping you achieving things:
<ol>
<li>You decide you'd rather not do something because you are unsure what to expect </li>
<li>You aim small so to be not disappointed</li>
<li>You avoid failure by staying in your comfort zone. </li>
<li>You adopt an all or nothing approach, if you can’t put 110% into something you won't do it. </li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>We also looked at facing your fears by doing these few things:
<ol>
<li>Look at your fears from a diﬀerent perspective</li>
<li>Think positive</li>
<li>Act on your fears</li>
</ol>
</p>


<p>Also, we look at a man called Yashar Nejati who is Co-Founder & CEO thisopenspace which finds a perfect space for any event for example a pop retail store. Yashar Nejati is an Iranian-Canadian who was a refugee, and two-time political prisoner. He arrived in Canada in 1992 at age six with his mother. When looking at his journey to Canada and his experiences as a refugee there were some comparisons to being a refugee and an entrepreneur, which are:
<ol>
<ul>An unimaginably high tolerance for risk  </ul> 
<ul>No other path  </ul> 
<ul>Eternally optimistic  </ul> 
<ul>Never give up  </ul> 
<ul>Kindness of strangers  </ul> 
<ul> Move on, fast  </ul> 
<ul>Break the rules </ul>  
		</ol>

						<h3>Learning Summary</h3>
							<p> This week’s lecture was a group critique of everyone work. This was very interesting as I got to see what other people's promotional websites looked like and how they were designed. This also inspired me to make few changes to my own as everyone came up with different ideas that I didn’t think of but will like to include into mine own promotional website. This week and until the submission date which is the 8th of January I will be making sure I have everything completed before this date.</p>
